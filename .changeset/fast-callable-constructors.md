Speed up callable tagged constructors whose type-side fields can be copied directly, such as primitives, literals, and unions of those identity types. Structs, Arrays, child Messages, checked fields, contextual fields, opaque schemas, oneOf unions, and other composite fields continue through Schema validation. In a warmed Node 22.22.3 benchmark on Effect 4.0.0-rc.109, `ClickedReset()` fell from 177.8 ns to 30.5 ns per call and `ClickedItem({ id })` fell from 257.5 ns to 73.7 ns per call.

The Vite plugin now includes SchemaAST in its forced Effect prebundle for this runtime dependency.

The fast path assumes typed data-property call sites. Calls that bypass TypeScript can now construct eligible variants with wrong primitive types or missing required fields. Accessor properties fall back to Schema validation. Stateful accessor Proxy traps are outside the fast-path equivalence boundary. Decode untrusted input through the Schema as before.
