# Project Organization

Start a Foldkit application in one module. Split it when a feature becomes easier to understand as its own state machine.

## Starting Simple

The smallest application keeps Model, Messages, init, update, and view in `main.ts`. A separate `entry.ts` creates and runs the runtime. Tests can then import `main.ts` without booting the application as a side effect.

Add `story.test.ts` and `scene.test.ts` beside it. The [Counter example](/example-apps/counter) shows this layout.

## File Layout

When one file becomes hard to navigate, separate the root pieces and give each [Submodel](/core/submodel) its own feature folder.

    ├── index.ts           Re-exports domain modules

```

Each feature folder owns its Model, Messages, update, view, Commands, Subscriptions, and tests. Do not create empty files only to match the diagram. Add a file when the feature has that concern.

Keep Commands beside the update that returns them. A feature that fetches its own data owns that Command instead of importing it from a root Command collection. Extract `message.ts` when a Command needs to import its result Message constructors without creating a cycle.

A feature that declares Subscriptions owns `subscription.ts`. The parent lifts that record into its own Model and Message types. See [Subscription Organization](/patterns/subscription-organization).

Split a large feature again only when its own files become difficult to navigate. The [Typing Terminal room source](https://github.com/foldkit/foldkit/tree/main/packages/typing-game/client/src/page/room) has `view/` and `update/` subfolders inside one Room feature.

## Where Tests Live

Colocate tests with the boundary they exercise. A feature's `story.test.ts` drives its update. Its `scene.test.ts` drives its view, using `withViewInputs` when the view requires them.

Test rendering, interactions, Commands, and OutMessages inside the feature that owns them. Test at the parent when the contract involves parent-computed ViewInputs, wrapper routing, a lifted Command, or the parent's response to an OutMessage.

Keep root Scene tests for flows that cross features or pages. Split several root flows by subject, such as `checkout.scene.test.ts` and `cart.scene.test.ts`.

When one folder holds more than one test of a kind, prefix with the subject, like `login.story.test.ts`. Pure modules in `domain/` need neither primitive; they take ordinary Vitest tests beside them.

See the [Testing](/testing) page for the full Story and Scene reference.

## Domain Modules

Put shared business concepts in `domain/`. Each module owns its Schema and pure operations.

::Snippet{name="domainModule" label="domain module"}

Import the module as a namespace and call operations such as `Cart.addItem` and `Cart.removeItem`.

## Index Re-exports {#index-reexports}

Use `index.ts` only as a barrel. Re-export the feature's modules from it.

::Snippet{name="indexReexports" label="index re-exports"}

Consumers can then import the feature as a namespace.

::Snippet{name="indexUsage" label="namespace usage"}

`Home.` exposes the feature's public surface without revealing its internal file layout.
