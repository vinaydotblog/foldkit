# Foldkit UI

## Overview

Foldkit UI is a set of headless, accessible UI components. You provide markup and styling through a `toView` callback. Foldkit UI provides attribute bundles, keyboard behavior, and state management where the interaction requires it.

## Installation

`@foldkit/ui` is a separate package from `foldkit`. Projects scaffolded by `create-foldkit-app` from an example that uses UI components already include it. Its peer dependencies are `foldkit` and `effect`, which every Foldkit project already has. Add it to any other project with:

```sh
npm install @foldkit/ui
```

## Component Categories

Components are either stateful Submodels or stateless render helpers.

Stateful [Submodels](/core/submodel), including Menu, Listbox, Combobox, Calendar, Dialog, and Popover, have their own Model, Message union, update, and OutMessage. Embed them with `h.submodel` and fold their OutMessages into the parent update.

Stateless render helpers, including Button, Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Switch, Disclosure, Fieldset, and Nav, take a `ViewConfig` and your builder and return Html. They bundle ARIA, data, and event attributes for DOM elements that you render. They need no child Model or `h.submodel` wiring. The builder determines the Message type returned by their callbacks, so you do not provide a Message type argument.

The Kind column below identifies each component category.

Underneath the floating components sits [Anchor](/ui/anchor), the positioning runtime Listbox, Combobox, Menu, Popover, Tooltip, and Date Picker share. It is neither a helper nor a Submodel, so it has no row above. Reach for it directly only when you are building an anchored component none of those cover.

## Showcase

The [UI Showcase](/example-apps/ui-showcase) demonstrates every component with styled, interactive examples. Use its source to see parent-child wiring, OutMessage folds, and view composition in one application.
