# Slider

## Overview

A numeric range input for values that sit on a continuous or stepped scale. Common uses include rating scales, volume controls, filter thresholds, and brightness settings. Follows the WAI-ARIA slider pattern with `role="slider"`, full keyboard navigation, and pointer drag.

## Examples

Slider is headless. Your `toView` callback controls all markup and styling. The component hands back attribute groups for the root, track, filled track, thumb, label, and an optional hidden input for form submission.

## Subscriptions

Pointer drag needs document-level `pointermove` / `pointerup` tracking (the cursor can leave the slider element). Slider exposes this as a Subscription you wire into your app’s `subscriptions` alongside an Escape-key Subscription that cancels an in-progress drag. The example snippet above shows the full wiring.

## Styling

Slider exposes `data-dragging` while the user is actively dragging, `data-disabled` when disabled, `data-readonly` when read-only, and `data-orientation` on the root. The `filledTrack` attribute group carries an inline width so the filled portion always matches the current value.

| Attribute          | Condition                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data-dragging`    | Present on the root, track, filled track, and thumb while the user is actively dragging. |
| `data-disabled`    | Present on all groups when isDisabled is true.                                           |
| `data-readonly`    | Present on all groups when isReadOnly is true.                                           |
| `data-orientation` | Present on the root. Always "horizontal"; vertical orientation is not supported.         |

## Keyboard Interaction

| Key                     | Description                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ArrowRight / ArrowUp`  | Increases the value by one step.                                         |
| `ArrowLeft / ArrowDown` | Decreases the value by one step.                                         |
| `PageUp`                | Increases the value by ten steps.                                        |
| `PageDown`              | Decreases the value by ten steps.                                        |
| `Home`                  | Jumps to the minimum value.                                              |
| `End`                   | Jumps to the maximum value.                                              |
| `Escape`                | During a pointer drag, cancels the drag and restores the pre-drag value. |

Every key in this table is inert when `isDisabled` or `isReadOnly` is true, because both remove the thumb's keydown handler. Escape is the exception. It cancels a drag through a Subscription rather than the handler, so a drag that began before the slider became read-only can still be cancelled, and can still run to pointerup on its own. Flipping `isReadOnly` mid-drag does not interrupt the drag in flight. `isDisabled` behaves the same way.

## Accessibility

The thumb receives `role="slider"`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, `aria-valuenow`, and `aria-orientation`. When `formatValue` is provided, the formatted string is announced via `aria-valuetext`. By default the thumb is labeled via `aria-labelledby` pointing at the id carried on the `label` attribute group; you can override this with an explicit `ariaLabel` or `ariaLabelledBy`.

`isReadOnly` and `isDisabled` both stop the Slider from reacting to pointer drags and keys. They differ in the semantics exposed to assistive technology, so they are not interchangeable.

`aria-disabled="true"`, which `isDisabled` emits, communicates that the Slider is unavailable. `aria-readonly="true"`, which `isReadOnly` emits, communicates that its value cannot be changed but remains relevant to the user. It sits on the thumb, the element carrying `role="slider"`. Both states keep `tabindex="0"`, following Foldkit's convention that unavailable controls remain discoverable by keyboard and assistive technology.

Assistive technology support for `aria-readonly` on sliders varies. Pair it with a visible read-only treatment or explanatory text when users must distinguish it from disabled, and test the browser and assistive technology combinations your app supports.

Use `isReadOnly` when the value is still information the user needs, such as a level set by another control, and `isDisabled` when the Slider is unavailable.

The two flags are independent. Setting both emits both sets of attributes, and either one on its own removes the pointer and keyboard handlers.

Use it when the numeric value needs a natural-language form (e.g. "3 of 10" or "50 percent").                                                                       |
| `isDisabled`      | `boolean`                                         | `false` | Whether the slider is disabled. Removes pointer and keyboard interactivity while preserving focusability.                                                                                                                    |

When provided, a hidden input carrying the current numeric value is included for native form submission.                                                                                                    |
| `getTrackRoot`    | `(() => Document \| ShadowRoot) \| undefined`     | —       | Optional accessor returning the DOM root that contains the slider track. Defaults to `document`. Override when rendering inside a Shadow DOM so the drag subscription can find the track element to measure cursor position. |

### SliderAttributes {#slider-attributes}

Attribute groups provided to the `toView` callback.

| Name          | Type                                | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `root`        | `ReadonlyArray<Attribute<Message>>` | —       | Spread onto the outer wrapper. Carries data-slider-id, data-orientation, and state data attributes.                                                                                                  |
| `track`       | `ReadonlyArray<Attribute<Message>>` | —       | Spread onto the track element (the bar). Carries data-slider-track-id (used by the drag subscription to measure cursor position), positioning styles, and the pointerdown handler for click-to-jump. |
| `filledTrack` | `ReadonlyArray<Attribute<Message>>` | —       | Spread onto an element nested inside the track. Its inline width reflects the current value as a percentage of the range.                                                                            |
| `thumb`       | `ReadonlyArray<Attribute<Message>>` | —       | Spread onto the draggable handle. Carries role="slider", tabindex, aria-value\*, the pointerdown handler, the keyboard handler, and positioning.                                                     |
| `label`       | `ReadonlyArray<Attribute<Message>>` | —       | Spread onto the visible label element. Carries the id the thumb’s aria-labelledby points to by default.                                                                                              |
| `hiddenInput` | `ReadonlyArray<Attribute<Message>>` | —       | Spread onto a hidden `<input>` for form submission. Only populated when the name prop is set.                                                                                                        |

### OutMessage {#out-message}

Messages emitted to the parent through the third element of `[Model, Commands, Option<OutMessage>]`. Parents fold the OutMessage in the `foldOutMessage` of their [`Update.foldChild`](/core/submodel#fold-child) config.

| Name           | Type                | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ChangedValue` | `{ value: number }` | —       | Emitted whenever the slider value changes via drag, click-to-jump, or keyboard navigation. Fold it in the `foldOutMessage` of your Slider fold to react, for example: persist the value, validate, or trigger a downstream Command. |
