// Add a field to your Model for the Animation Submodel. Animation tracks
// its own visibility and lifecycle state. No need for a separate flag:
const Model = S.Struct({
  animation: Animation.Model,
  // ...your other fields
})

// In your init function, initialize the Animation Submodel with a unique id:
const init = () => [
  {
    animation: Animation.init({ id: 'content' }),
    // ...your other fields
  },
  [],
]

// Embed the Animation Message in your parent Message:
const GotAnimationMessage = m('GotAnimationMessage', {
  message: Animation.Message,
})

// At module scope, fold the OutMessage into your own Model. It signals
// lifecycle events Animation can't handle on its own. Most importantly, it
// tells you when a leave animation has started so you can provide the Command
// that listens for animation settlement. That Command's result is an Animation
// Message, so use `liftCommand` from the fold context to lift it into the
// parent Message type. Each arm returns an Update.Step over the parent Model,
// which already has the next Animation Model written back:
const foldAnimationOutMessage = (
  outMessage: Animation.OutMessage,
  { liftCommand }: Update.FoldContext<Animation.Message, Message>,

      // Animation handles enter completion internally but hands leave
      // settlement detection to you here, because the strategy varies
      // by consumer. For example, Foldkit's Dialog just waits for CSS,
      // while its Popover races CSS against the anchor button scrolling
      // off-screen. defaultLeaveCommand is the default strategy: it
      // waits for every CSS transition and keyframe animation on the
      // element to settle, then dispatches EndedAnimation back into
      // Animation.update. Use it unless you need a custom strategy.

        [liftCommand(Animation.defaultLeaveCommand(model.animation))],
      ],
      // TransitionedOut is Animation's signal that the leave has fully
      // settled (your leave Command's EndedAnimation message has been
      // processed). Return Commands for any post-animation work, for
      // example: close a native dialog, remove an entry from a list,
      // release a resource. No Commands here because animateSize keeps the
      // element mounted (collapsed to zero height) so there's nothing to
      // tear down.
      TransitionedOut: () => model => [model, []],
    }),

// Update.foldChild wires the child into the parent: it runs Animation.update,
// writes the next Animation Model back, maps the Submodel's Commands into your
// Message type, and hands any OutMessage to foldOutMessage.

GotAnimationMessage: ({ message }) => foldAnimation(model, message)

// Inside your view function, toggle visibility by dispatching Animation.Showed()
// or Hid() wrapped in your parent Message. model.animation.isShowing is your
// source of truth for whether content is currently visible. The Animation
// view wraps your content. Data attributes drive the CSS transitions or
// keyframe animations defined in className:
